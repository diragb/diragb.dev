    it has often filled me with equal parts confusion and a deep sense of pity whenever i have learned of the fruitless misadventures of the greatly ambitious, who, when
    one engages in conversation with them, declares confidently - sometimes too confidently - their plans and ideas, to achieve what they think they need to, or should, achieve.<br />
    <br />
    this deep and treacherous chasm between that which one wills to achieve, and what one eventually settles for - it is an insidious, antediluvian predator of hope, one that was
    perhaps born with civilization. perhaps, civilization was born through it, as zeus was born of the wrathful titan kronos, the great time.<br />
    <br />
    yet - of all the killers there are of man's dreams, hopes, and ambitions - the one that lurks quietly, luring the unserious and the naive with its shimmering dazzle, like an anglerfish
    luring her prey, is, perhaps, a disease borne out of comfort, and luxury.<br />
    <br />
    this disease, this killer of many a hopeful <i>arriviste</i>, deludes the unprepared into misjudging not only his value - providing, perhaps, a warm sense of grandeur and
    accomplishment - but also discreetly, as if puppeteering his being, leads his spirit to sell itself for half its worth.<br />
    <br />
    there is a distinct (and tragically, often humorous) vacuity that envelopes a man that is afflicted by this disease. the symptoms are serious, the prognosis dire - and should this
    mentally ill individual be allowed to have his way - out of perhaps a blind, grandmotherly kindess - then he will proceed to destroy not only what he is, but also what civilization has accomplished.<br />
    <br />
    hence, civilization was born and shaped-up with structural checks and balances that disallow and discourage such tumors to infect other healthy tissues. unfortunately - and the fortunateness in this
    circumstance is the anthropocentric opinion of what counts as good fortune, which is often at odds with what nature <b>is</b> - this sickness of being afflicts both the impoverished
    and the <i>avoir du pognon</i>.<br />
    <br />
    thus perverted, they view their counterparts as having a knight worth one point, a bishop worth two, and a pawn that secretly spies for them instead. this delusion leads one to strategic blunders - 
    blunders that they cannot see coming, and if intoxicated enough with avarice, argue against the validity of the generous checkmate that is delivered unto them.<br />
    <br />
    "but what kindness is there in defeat?"<br />
    <br />
    is defeat not the best educator of what success demands? was it not yama, the god of death, that taught nachiketa what life - in its truest essence - is?<br />
    <br />
    intellectual lethargy, however, poisons those who know themselves to be farthest from it. insidiously, their perception of virtue is shifted from seeking the truth, to defending their own
    truth against external and internal cross-examination.<br />
    <br />
    gradually, this desire for achieving is perverted into the ruthless maintenance of that which has been achieved. but success is transitory, and thus one should aim to not preserve their
    successes but rather their desire to succeed, one should not preserve the ashes, but keep the fire inside one's heart raging.<br />
    <br />
    a flickering flame pursues cheap gambits - sacrifices it considers to be strategic, or sells off as being wise. in actuality, these gambits are moves that not only lose, but demonstrate sheer
    incompetence on the part of the successor of the world. such is the sheer timidity of this erstwhile victor that he would rather feign archaic wisdom than choose to think and play the winning moves.
    such arrogance is in that flame, that it would call inaction its strategic advantage. perhaps, even refer to inaction as being the reason as to why he is the victor, for he allows everything
    to rip him apart.<br />
    <br />
    such arrogance leads to crushing defeat. however, it is never too late to start winning. the key to building the steps to success are analogous to how one plays positionally. such a game is not glamorous,
    and certainly does not feed either the grandeur or the glamor of the arrogant victor. however, if survival - not merely victory - is his goal, and he is sufficiently woken up
    from the intoxicating effects of being in the company of the lotus-eating thoughts in his mind, then he must at once let go of this pride that no longer fits him.<br />
    <br />
    he must at once realize that the seeds of his destruction were planted by fate herself at the exact moment when the victor enjoyed his first victory, and now, the crop wil soon be ready for harvest.<br />
